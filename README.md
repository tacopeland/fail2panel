# IMPORTANT NOTE:
This readme is for the finished version, not the current version. The current version is unfinished and requires strange solutions like installing fail2ban from github as a Python3.8 library for the root user, and running a Flask server in Python3.8 because Python3.9 breaks fail2ban. The final version will use Haskell for its backend and not have any runtime dependencies.


# fail2ban web panel

This is a web panel for fail2ban, with a backend REST API built on Flask and a frontend built with Elm.

## Requirements

To compile this you need a few things:
- [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html)
- [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)

## Installation
